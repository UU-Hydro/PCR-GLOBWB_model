# PCR-GLOBWB

PCR-GLOBWB (PCRaster Global Water Balance) is a large-scale hydrological model intended for global to regional studies and developed at the Department of Physical Geography, Utrecht University (Netherlands). This repository holds the model scripts of PCR-GLOBWB. 

For additional information about the model please checkout the PCR-GLOBWB documentation at https://pcrglobwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Please also see the file README.txt.

## Input and output files (including OPeNDAP-based access: https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/catalog/data2/pcrglobwb/catalog.html)

The input files for the runs made in the aformentioned paper (Sutanudjaja et al., 2018) are available on the OPeNDAP server: https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/catalog/data2/pcrglobwb/version_2019_11_beta/pcrglobwb2_input/catalog.html. The OPeNDAP protocol (https://www.opendap.org) allow users to access PCR-GLOBWB input files from the remote server and perform PCR-GLOBWB runs **without** the need to download the input files (with total size ~250 GB for the global extent).

Some output files are also provided: https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/catalog/data2/pcrglobwb/version_2019_11_beta/example_output/global_05min_gmd_paper_output/catalog.html. More output files are available on https://geo.data.uu.nl/research-pcrglobwb/pcr-globwb_gmd_paper_sutanudjaja_et_al_2018/ (for requesting access, please send an e-mail to E.H.Sutanudjaja@uu.nl).

## How to install

Please follow the following steps required to install PCR-GLOBWB:

 1. You will need a working Python environment, we recommend to install Miniconda, particularly for Python 3. Follow their instructions given at https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. The user guide and short reference on conda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).

 2. Get the requirement or environment file from this repository [conda_env/pcrglobwb_py3.yml](conda_env/pcrglobwb_py3.yml) and use it to install all modules required (e.g. PCRaster, netCDF4) to run PCR-GLOBWB:

    `conda env create --name pcrglobwb_python3 -f pcrglobwb_py3.yml`

    This will create a environment named *pcrglobwb_python3*.

 3. Activate the environment in a command prompt:

    `conda activate pcrglobwb_python3`

 4. Clone or download this repository. We suggest to use the latest version of the model, which should also be in the default branch. 

    `git clone https://github.com/UU-Hydro/PCR-GLOBWB_model.git`

    This will clone PCR-GLOBWB into the current working directory.


## PCR-GLOBWB configuration .ini file

For running PCR-GLOBWB, a configuration .ini file is required. Some configuration .ini file examples are given in the *config* directory. To be able to run PCR-GLOBWB using these .ini file examples, there are at least two things that must be adjusted. 

First, please make sure that you edit or set the *outputDir* (output directory) to the directory that you have access. You do not need to create this directory manually.  

Moreover, please also make sure that the *cloneMap* file is stored locally in your computing machine. The *cloneMap* file defines the spatial resolution and extent of your study area and must be in the pcraster format. Some examples are given in this repository [clone_landmask_maps/clone_landmask_examples.zip](clone_landmask_maps/clone_landmask_examples.zip).

By default, the configuration .ini file examples given in the *config* directory will use PCR-GLOBWB input files from the 4TU.ResearchData server, as set in their *inputDir* (input directory). 

`inputDir = https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/dodsC/data2/pcrglobwb/version_2019_11_beta/pcrglobwb2_input/`

This can be adjusted to any (local) locations, e.g. if you have the input files stored locally in your computing machine. 


## How to run

Please make sure that the correct conda environment in a command prompt:

`conda activate pcrglobwb_python3`

Go to to the PCR-GLOBWB *model* directory. You can start a PCR-GLOBWB run using the following command: 

`python deterministic_runner.py <ini_configuration_file>`

where <ini_configuration_file> is the configuration file of PCR-GLOBWB. 


## Exercises/cooking recipes 

We included some exercise/cooking recipes for running PCR-GLOBWB. You can find these documents in the folder [exercise](exercise) within this repository. While these exercises were generally designed for our own computing facilities (e.g. velocity and eejit servers), they should be adaptable for use on other computing machines.
