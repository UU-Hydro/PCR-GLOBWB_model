compute_day_length_correction: function that compute the correction for shift \
between the incoming shortwave radiation during the daylight period (equal to \
the day length, over which Rs is accumulated) and the moment the relative \
humidity is at its lowest or the temperature is at its maximum (R@Tmax).
The correction is adopted and modified after Winslow et al. (2001).

The day length is entered in hours and converted internally to 2 * pi for \
a duration of 24 hours. The radiation distribution over the day is linearized \
and centred on 12 AM (noon), when the radiation is the maximum
The function assumes that the maximum temperature is \
reached at 3 PM (day length of 0.5 * pi). If the day length is equal to shorter \
than 6 hours (Rs occurring before or at 3 PM), the correction is limited to 1, \
if this falls later, more incoming shortwave radiation is received as the \
duration over the radiation comes in through an atmosphere with less relative \
humidity and thus can reach the surface more uninterrupted, increases.


The correction factor rs_rtmax_cor then is computed from:

    Rs/R@Tmax = (1 - 0.25 * (D - 0.5 * pi) ** 2 / D ** 2) ** -1
    
where D is the day length scaled to 2 * pi radians for 24 hours and D cannot \
be smaller than 0.5 * pi (equivalent to Tmax at 3 PM, so Rs/R@Tmax = 1).

    """

shortwave_radiation: class that updates on a daily timestep the incoming \
shortwave radiation in the form of spatial PCRaster maps holding the following \
variables:
    - extraterrestrial radiation;
    - actual radiation at the earth's surface.

These quantities are computed on the basis of the following information:
    - latitude;
    - surface elevation.
    - julian day number within the year;
    - climate variables: precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature on
      a daily basis and mean annual temperature.

The modification from extraterrestrial radiation to cloud-free shortwave \
radiation and to the actual shortwave radiation contains in total three static \
transmissivity components for cloud-free skies and two conceptualized factors \
to represent the course in humidity over the day, that are all available in \
the class.

Units of the output depend on the units of the solar constant, which by default \
is defined in [MJ/m2/day].

The computation of the extraterrestrial radiation is based on Dingman's \
